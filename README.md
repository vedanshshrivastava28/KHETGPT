🌾 AI-Driven Farming Advisor
A smart multi-agent AI system designed to optimize agricultural practices, support farmers with crop recommendations, and facilitate sustainable agriculture using machine learning.

🚀 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a hackathon challenge. It aims to assist farmers by analyzing agricultural data and recommending the most suitable crop for cultivation. The system uses real-time data inputs and historical insights to enhance productivity and ensure environmentally responsible farming.

🎯 Problem Statement
Farmers often struggle to choose the right crop based on soil quality, previous crop yield, and chemical usage. The lack of technical support and decision-making tools leads to inefficient farming practices, low yield, and financial loss.

💡 Proposed Solution
An AI-powered advisory system that:

Analyzes key agricultural parameters like fertilizer usage, pesticide usage, and crop type.

Provides accurate crop recommendations.

Improves decision-making for farmers.

Supports sustainable agriculture practices.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn – ML modeling

Pandas – Data processing

Tkinter – GUI Dashboard

Graphviz – Flowchart visualization

SQLite (optional) – Agent memory

Matplotlib/Seaborn – (for visualization, if needed)

🔧 Features
Crop recommendation using ML models.

Professional dashboard using Tkinter.

Multi-agent architecture (Farmer Advisor, Market Analyst, etc.).

Flowchart to represent agent interaction.

Clean and modular code structure.

🧠 Agents Interaction Design
Farmer Advisor: Takes field and input details to recommend crops.

Market Analyst: Provides demand and profitability insights.

Data Logger (optional): Stores recommendations for learning and analysis.
